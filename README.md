# GrowStake(Stake that Helps You Grow)
 A website where friends challenge each other to achieve goals. You create a "Pact" with a deadline and a monetary stake (e.g., ₹500). If you fail, you lose your money. If you succeed, you win a share of the pot. It's motivation powered by friendly competition and real consequences.
 How It Works (The 4 Steps):
 * Create a Pact: A user sets a clear goal (e.g., "Run 50km this month"), a firm deadline, and the stake amount.
 * Invite & Commit: They invite friends who join by paying their stake into a secure online pot (escrow).
 * Prove It: Before the deadline, participants upload proof of completion (a photo, screenshot, or document).
 * Win & Get Paid: The group votes or a referee verifies the proof. The platform automatically pays out the winnings to those who succeeded.
